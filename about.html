		<h1>about us</h1>
		<p class="indented">Hey there! Welcome to Imula Plant Boutique. A little bit about us...
		We created Imula Plant Boutique in 2020 because, quite simply, we love plants. One of our favorite parts of operating Imula Plant Boutique is sourcing the most beautiful and exotic plants that we can get our hands on, and of course sharing them with all of you. 
		Our storefront is located in Banna Ilocos Norte, that we renovated ourselves in our backyard. In our shop, you'll find a carefully curated selection of both indoor and garden plants. 
		Plants transform your space, elevate your mood, boost your creativity and even
		improve your health. Whether you’re plant obsessed or a first time plant parent, we’ve got everything you need to keep your green friends happy, healthy and thriving.</p>
